	 Learning has gone beyond class-rooms where social learning is promoted in almost all the leading e-learning
	 website. Students can take classes from e-learning websites and discuss their learning’s or doubts using
	 various social media channels. For Example NPTEL, Udemy, YouTube, etc. Students can make use of live video
	 that is a part of so many social networking sites to engage themselves in classes. Students can share study
	 materials through social networking sites like Facebook, Instagram and even Whats App.
  -><b>For Creative Expression:</b>

	 the thought of what will happen if they express themselves. It helps students to share their thoughts without
	 any fear. Social media allows students to express in many ways, like by posting photos, blogs, individual
	 articles, videos, audio clips etc. This helps students to come out of the box and explore their talents. Such
	 events will identify the student’s talents and give them opportunities further in life.
  -><b>Experience Global Exposure:</b>

	 students to interact with people on such a broad platform, indeed they get immense knowledge from it, which
	 is amazing, isn’t it. They even get to know about the diverse cultures present around the world. That includes
	 their culture, traditions, language, lifestyle, food habits, and many more interestingly beautiful things.
	 They can even learn about the different courses present in universities from all around the world.
  -><b>Employment Opportunities:</b>

	 student finishing his/her degree it’s very difficult for them to get a job. Social media helps them to grab
	 opportunities.Many companies update about openings in their social media accounts. Students following these
	 companies on social media can apply by sending them their resumes. LinkedIn is one such social media platform
	 where students apply for internships and jobs extensively.

</br>
<pre id="whyuse">
 Social media sites have become invaluable tools in education, marketing and communication. Social media plays an 
 important role in every student’s life. It is often easier and more convenient to access information, provide 
 information and communicate via social media. Tutors and students can be connected to each other and can make good 
 use of these platforms for the benefit of their learning and teaching.
 
 -><b>Instant online discussions</b>
	Social media is the go to medium for people to interact. Current staff and students, prospective staff and 
	students, alumni, stakeholders and the wider community can all communicate with like-minded individuals and have 
	their questions answered, make friends and network.
 
 -><b>Relationships</b>
	Social media can used to connect to students, prospective students, researchers and other organisations, but 
	at its heart, social media is about creating relationships with people.

 -><b>Knowledge Sharing</b>
	Social media provides a platform where you can share your knowledge and gain credibility in your chosen field(s) 
	or specialism(s). Within an online community, you can also acquire information and insights from others who have 
	already been where you are now or have completed similar research.
	
 -><b>Low cost</b>
	It can be very cost effective communication medium and is usually free for the end-user. Not only can you use it 
	to communicate, but it is also an excellent promotional tool for things like events, new courses and research 
	advances.
	
 -><b>Connect at any time</b>
	Social networking never sleeps. You might not get an instant reply from someone local at 3am, but most social 
	networking sites are not restricted by geography and there is often someone to chat to from the international 
	community. Or you can post a question and wait until daylight.
	
 -><b>vBranding</b>
	Many people are increasingly spending a great deal of time on social networking sites. Social media should be 
	seen as a wide-reaching tool to reach a huge audience and so getting your name, the university’s name out there 
	on the web, in the way we choose, is incredibly important.
	
 -><b>Social media content is now integrated with search results</b>
	Search engines like Google and Bing are increasingly indexing and ranking information from social networks. The 
	more presence we have on social media sites, the higher our ratings become in online search results. This makes 
	it increasingly important that we present ourselves in a positive light.

<sma> Role of Social Media in Pandemic </sma>
<pre id="role">
 Taking a look at how students used social media to share information and interact with others throughout 
 the COVID-19 pandemic:
 
 -><b>A source of information</b>
	COVID-19 marked the first global pandemic in the age of social media. Governments and brands used 
	social media to provide people with a better understanding of events and their impacts
	
 -><b>An influence on public response to the outbreak</b>
	Billions of people are free to publicly share their opinions regarding a pandemic through various 
	social media platforms. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw individuals, organizations, and businesses 
	use social media to spread awareness of the virus, as well as the public actions that can be taken.
	
 -><b>A marketing platform</b>
	The COVID-19 outbreak presented a defining moment for many brands in how they chose to market their 
	product.
	
 -><b>A powerful way to bring positivity to a scary time</b>
	No platform is perfect. But while we saw misinformation and fear on social media, there was also an abundance 
	of lifesaving information, connection with others, and global unity. Social media gave us the ability to share 
	experiences with family and friends to help combat both literal and emotional isolation while also reminding 
	us that we’re all in this together.
